# DNS Validator
Maintains a list of IPv4 DNS servers by verifying them against baseline servers, and ensuring accurate responses.

DNS Validator's approach is different to other DNS query validation tools. This tool performs multiple validation steps on each resolver:

* Baselines non-geolocated domain names against "trusted" public DNS resolvers, `1.1.1.1`, `8.8.8.8` and `9.9.9.9` 
  * For each resolver being tested DNS Validator ensures that each baselined domain name resolves to the same IP Address.
    * Servers that return an answer that differs from the baseline are immediately skipped
* Performs DNS lookup of known commonly spoofed DNS addresses to ensure NXDOMAIN is returned when expected.
  * Resolvers that do not return NXDOMAIN for random subdomains of known target domains are immediately skipped.

# Usage

| Argument   | Description                                                                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (stdin)    | Pipe target lists from another application to verify. |
| -t         | Specify a target DNS server to verify. |
| -tL        | Specify a list of targets or a URL to a list of targets |
| -e         | Specify a target exclusion. |
| -eL        | Specify a list of targets or a URL to a list of targets to exclude. |
| -r         | Specify a root domain to compare to. Must be non-geolocated or most resolvers will fail. |
| -q         | Specify a resolver query to use (default:dnsvalidator) |
| -threads   | Specify the maximum number of threads to run at any one time (DEFAULT:5)                                     |
| -timeout   | Specify a timeout value in seconds for any single thread (DEFAULT:600)                                       |
| -o         | Specify an output file to write successful output to. |
| --no-color | If set then any foreground or background colours will be stripped out                                        |
| --silent   | If set then only successfully resolved servers will be displayed and banners and other information will be redacted. |
| -v         | If set then verbose output will be displayed in the terminal.                                                 |

# Setup
Install using:
```
$ python3 setup.py install
```
Dependencies will then be installed and DNS Validator will be added to your path as `dnsvalidator`.

# Examples:

## CLI:

```bash
$ dnsvalidator -tL https://public-dns.info/nameservers.txt -threads 20 -o resolvers.txt
```

## Docker:

Build 

```bash
$ docker build -t dnsvalidator .
```

Run:

```bash
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/dnsvalidator/output -t dnsvalidator -tL https://public-dns.info/nameservers.txt -threads 20 -o /dnsvalidator/output/resolvers.txt
```

# Caveats

* **WARNING** Keep the thread count to a reasonable level and/or use a VPS/VPN appropriately. Pushing the thread count too high can make it look like you are attempting to attack DNS servers, resulting in network level DNS blocks from your ISP. _Ask us how we know..._ 
* Only IPv4 DNS Resolvers are validated at the current time. IPv6 resolvers are skipped.
* Root domains used for baseline tests must not be geolocated; specifically they must return the same IP address regardless of the location on the planet they are resolved from. Domains such as `google.com` or `facebook.com` (and many others) are not suitable for baselines, as they return a geo-located IP address when resolved.
  * Using a root domain that is geo-located will result in only resolvers local to the user being returned as valid.
